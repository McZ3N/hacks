# Branching

#### Unconditional branching

The JMP instruction is a basic control flow instruction in assembly that performs an unconditional jump to a specified location in code. If a program's execution is directed to another location it will continue processing from that point.

{% hint style="info" %}
The basic `jmp` instruction is unconditional, which means that it will always jump to the specified location, regardless of the conditions.

Unconditional branching will always jump is not suitable for loops as it will loop forever.
{% endhint %}

Conditional Branching is where the flow of execution is directed based on certain conditions, based on the Destination and Source operands. A conditional jump instruction has multiple varieties as `Jcc`, where `cc` represents the Condition Code.

<table><thead><tr><th width="147">Instruction</th><th width="145">Condition</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>jz</td><td>D = 0</td><td>Destination equal to 0</td></tr><tr><td>jnz</td><td>D != 0</td><td>Destnation not equal to 0</td></tr><tr><td>js</td><td>D &#x3C; 0</td><td>Destination is negative</td></tr><tr><td>jsn</td><td>D >=</td><td>Destination is Not Negative (i.e. 0 or positive)</td></tr><tr><td>jg</td><td>D > S</td><td>Destination Greater than Source</td></tr><tr><td>jge</td><td>D >=</td><td>Destination Greater than or Equal Source</td></tr><tr><td>jl</td><td>D &#x3C; S</td><td>Destination Less than Source</td></tr><tr><td>jle</td><td>D &#x3C;= S</td><td>Destination Less than or Equal Source</td></tr></tbody></table>

The `cmovcc` (conditional move) instruction in assembly allows us to conditionally move data from one register to another only if a specific condition is met. This is different from regular `mov` instructions, which always move data without any condition.

```nasm
cmovz rax, rbx  ; Move rbx into rax if the condition (zero flag) is set, meaning the last result was zero.
```

#### RFLAG Register

When executing conditional instructions like `jmp`. The processor needs to know whether conditions are true or false. It uses the RFLAGS register which consists of 64-bits and it holds flag bits instead of values. Each bit 'or set of bits' turns to `1` or `0` depending on the value of the last instruction.

```nasm
mov eax, 1      ; eax = 1
dec eax         ; eax = 0
; ZF is now 1 (on) because result was zero
; This is called the "Zero" (ZR) condition

mov eax, 2      ; eax = 2
dec eax         ; eax = 1
; ZF is now 0 (off) because result was not zero
; This is called the "Not Zero" (NZ) condition
```

### <mark style="color:yellow;">CMP</mark>

If we want our program to stop at a certain value like 20 we can use `js loopExample` which will jump back took `loopExample` as long as the last instruction was a negative number. The compare instruction `cmp` compares 2 operands. by subtracting the second operand from first operand (i.e. `D1` - `S2`) and sets flag in RFLAGS.

#### So as example:

* When we have first number 1: `1 - 10 = -9`
  * Since -9 < 0, the jump condition is met
  * Program continues generating Fibonacci numbers
* When we reach 13: `13 - 10 = 3`
  * Since 3 > 0, the jump condition is not met
  * Program stops as we found first Fibonacci > 10
